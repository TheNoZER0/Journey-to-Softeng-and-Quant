C# vs .Net
    - .Net is a framwroek for building application on Windows
    - C# is a programming language

.Net Framwork:
    - Composed of two parts
    -   CLR (Common language runtime)
    -   Class Library

CLR
    - it is an application sitting in the memory whose job is to translate IL (Intermediate Language)
    -   this is the language understood by all OS) into the OS code, this is called JIT (Just-in-time Compilation)

Architechture of .NET
    - Applications consists of building blocks called classes

Class
    - A container that contains data (atributes) and functions (methods)
    - Funtions (methods) execute code
    - Data reperesents the state of the application
    - Example:
        -   A Car is a class, its make and its model is its Data or attributes, its ability to start and move is its function (method)
